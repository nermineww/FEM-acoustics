This paper presents results for the assessing of the first six natural frequencies 
and modal shapes of a 2D rectangular plate with dimensions 200 mm × 500 mm × 2 mm, 
supposedly a door, with motion restrictions in certain points, supposedly the door 
ringes and handle. The assessment was made via a self-taught algorithm in MATLAB 
and the results were compared to COMSOL simulations. The mesh, mass and stiffness 
matrices, as well as their assembling, is taught through the document. Symbolic 
language was used to enhance the learning process. A maximum error of 6.02% was 
found between the two approaches for the 3rd natural frequency. Future research 
with this approach includes the coupling between the plate and an air cavity and 
the assessing of the modal shapes and natural frequencies of this system.
